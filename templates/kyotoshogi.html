<p>Kyoto shogi is a shogi variant on a 5x5 board, but is quite different than standard shogi. It was invented by Tamiya Katsuya c. 1976. The main distinction is that each piece flips sides to a completely different piece with each move. Many of the piece combinations are puns relating to Kyoto. For example, the lance (kyo) is paired with the tokin (to), which makes "Kyoto."</p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>As this game is based off shogi, please see the corresponding guide for the piece movement rules first if you are not familiar with them.</p>
<p>The starting setup is as above. Unlike in shogi, each piece (except the King) must flip to the other side fater moving. All pieces represent a pair of pieces. Every piece in standard shogi is used except the dragon king and dragon horse.</p>
