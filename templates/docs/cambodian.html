<p>The only differences from Makruk are as follows:</p>
<p>If no pieces have been captured, the players have the options:</p>
<ul>
<li>on the king's first move, and only if not in check, of moving the king like a knight; and</li>
<li>on the queen's first move, of moving the queen two squares straight ahead</li>
</ul>
