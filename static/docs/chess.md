{% trans %}If you are familiar with chess, then you probably didn't come here to learn the rules of chess. Please try some variants!{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}If you are not familiar with chess, then the rules are widely available on the internet, such as on Wikipedia or premier chess sites like lichess.org and chess.com.{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}As with other variants, you can play chess on Pychess Variants against other people or the AI. You can also set custom positions by adjusting the [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) and play games with those using standard chess rules.{% endtrans %}
