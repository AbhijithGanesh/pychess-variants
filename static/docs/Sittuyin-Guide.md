## What is Sittuyin?

*Sittuyin*, or Burmese Chess is a classic board game native to Myanmar and is very similar to Makruk. The game is played in Myanmar, and although western chess is more popular there, there are efforts to revitalize the game. The pieces have the same movements as Makruk (Thai Chess), but the rules are slightly different.

## Rules

The general rules are extremely similar to Chess, so this guide will focus on the few differences. The boards are slightly different, with Sittuyin having two big diagonal lines dividing through the board. The sides are also red and black, with the red player moving first. The piece position in Sittuyin is much different compared to chess or Makruk. Key differences are as follows.

* For starters, the feudal lords (pawns) start on staggered ranks (as you can see in the board above). 
* To start the game, the players (starting with the red player) alternate back and forth placing the remainder of their pieces on their halves of the boards.
* After a feudal lord reaches a diagonal line, the player can choose to promote that piece intoa general instead of moving. This can only occur *if* their general has already been captured. If they choose not to promote, then that pawn cannot promote for the rest of the game.
* Creating stalemate is illegal.

Unlike the queen in chess, the general is a weak piece that only moves one space diagonally.

### Elephant
