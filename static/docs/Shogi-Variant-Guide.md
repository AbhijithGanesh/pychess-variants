# SHOGI VARIANTS

Currently, two shogi variants are available for play. They are both played on a 5x5 board. For the purposes of rules, it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with shogi rules. If not, please see that first.

# Minishogi

Minishogi is essentially shogi on a 5x5 board. The game was invented (or rediscovered) around 1970 by Shigenobu Kusumoto of Osaka, Japan.

## Rules

The starting setup is as above. Unlike standard shogi, there is no knight or lance. There is only one pawn, a bishhop and rook, and one of each general. Promotion is only done in the last rank. 

## Strategy

Due to the smaller board size, the rook and bishop are not as dominant as standard shogi. However, their promotions are still very much threatening.

# Kyoto Shogi

Kyoto shogi is also played on a 5x5 board, but is quite different than standard shogi. It was invented by Tamiya Katsuya c. 1976. The main distinction is that each piece flips sides to a completely different piece with each move. Many of the piece combinations are puns relating to Kyoto. For example, the lance (kyo) is paired with the tokin (to), which makes "Kyoto."

## Rules

The starting setup is as above. Unlike in shogi, each piece (except the King) must flip to the other side fater moving. All pieces represent a pair of pieces. Every piece in standard shogi is used except the dragon king and dragon horse.

Original piece | Other side
--- | ---
Tokin | Lance
Silver | Bishop
Gold | Knight
Pawn | Rook

Additional rules:

- When dropping a piece, you may choose *either* side to drop.
- You *can* move a piece such that it can't move until it's captured (this is illegal in standard shogi).
- Reptition: Repeating the same position results in a draw.

## Strategy

Still being worked out -- please feel free to offer advice as you find it!
