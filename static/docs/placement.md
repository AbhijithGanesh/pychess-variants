# ![Placement](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/icons/placement.svg) Placement Chess

Different than the “Placement Chess” described on the Chess Variants site, this variant is simply a modification where players take turns placing their back rank pieces. Castling only works when the king and the corresponding rook are in their normal position.
